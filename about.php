                <h2 class="text-primary">History of IDA</h2>
                <p>Ikwerre Development Association (IDA) came into being in 1978, when Chief E.O. Chike convened a meeting. Chief Chike was then the General Manager of Nigerian Tobacco Company, Port Harcourt. Eight prominent Ikwerre sons notably; Chief E.O. Chike, Mr. Magnus Elechi, Rowland Amaewhule, Chief Chike Wokekoro, Prof. Simeon Chituru Achinewhu, Dr. Cyprian Wonodi, and Chief Felix Atako, were the foundation members.</p>
                <p>It was conceived not to compete with the umbrella body (Ogbakor Ikwerre) but to augment where necessary. The assumption was that Ogbakor Ikwerre was mainly a cultural organization and as such may be limited in taking certain decisions on other social, economic, and political issues.</p>
                <p>In 1979, the constitution of IDA was written and adopted, and IDA was formally inaugurated at Elele civic centre.</p>
